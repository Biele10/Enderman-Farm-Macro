# Enderman-Farm-Macro
i created this macro using python. all information is inside the readme file which you will need in order to use the macro properly.


thank you for using this macro, i have no way of proving that it is safe so.. just trust me ðŸ˜….

########################### TO TURN OFF THE MACRO, PRESS THE ESC BUTTON AND SWING YOUR MOUSE TO ANY CORNER OF THE SCREEN, THIS WILL CLOSE THE PROGRAM ###########################

1. before turning on the macro, ensure you have placed blocks behind you and to your sides by the enderman farm (so that you don't fall off)
2. keep your sword/weapon in your first inventory slot as the program assumes this is where it will be and keep your food item in your 4th inventory slot
3. now that everything is set up, station the player to the far left or far right of your 'box' and run the macro, the macro will give you 4 seconds to open it and then move back to minecraft, so be quick
4. enderman farm is now automated
